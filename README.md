# CodeKataBattle - Requirements Engineering, Software Design and Implementation

### Requirement Engineering
Requirement Engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements for a software system. It involves gathering, analyzing, and prioritizing user needs and translating them into detailed specifications that guide the development process.

### Software Design
Software Design is the process of conceptualizing and planning the structure, components, and behavior of a software system to meet specified requirements. It encompasses architectural design, detailed design, and interface design, focusing on creating a blueprint for implementing the software.

### Implementation
This repository includes the implementation of the application designed through **Requirement Engineering** and **Software Design** processes. The implementation prioritizes mirroring the design and requirements, with less emphasis on the user interface. It aims to translate the architectural decisions, functional requirements, and design considerations outlined during earlier phases into a functional and robust application backend.
